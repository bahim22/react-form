	'I initially started developing Python Projects with Django.Then I transitioned to building websites with HTML and CSS3, eventually  implementing bootstrap packages with pre-built minified JavaScript for interactivity. I improved my vanilla JavaScript skills and learned ES6 and TypeScript and was able to start developing React.js and Next.js Web Apps. I was able to learn how to configure my toolchain and start building JAMstack Apps. I am currently building Full-Stack projects using multiple frameworks, libraries,and packages.';
